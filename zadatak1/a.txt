The library concepts listed on this page are the named requirements used in the normative
 text of the C++ standard to define the expectations of the standard library. It is expected
 that a future version of the C++ standard library will formalize these library
 concepts using the facilities of the above-mentioned technical specification. 
Until then, the burden is on the programmer to ensure that library templates are
 instantiated with template arguments that satisfy these concepts. Failure to do so may
 result in very complex compiler diagnostics.
